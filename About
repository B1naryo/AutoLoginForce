About

I improved the text while maintaining the essence of your message. Here's the revised version:

I created this program because I couldn't find a brute-force program that satisfied me.
Most brute-force programs tend to be complex and sometimes unreliable. Therefore, I decided to develop a program that meets my needs and works reliably.
This program allows me to observe real-time automated attacks on a login page using a list of passwords or a list of SQL injection payloads.
Using it is straightforward - simply modify the input variables and the URL, and then execute the script. 
I won't go into further detail because just providing this code is already a challenging task. 
If you struggle to use it, I'm sorry, but it may indicate that this field is not the right fit for you.
